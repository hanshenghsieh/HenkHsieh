    <h3>Hi, I‚Äôm Henk Hsieh ‚Äîa designer who enjoys solving complicated problems through creative approaches.</h3><br>
    <p>I regard myself as a strategic problem-solver who adopts design as a creative approach to build meaningful solutions to respective issues. With 2+ years of freelancing experience in college, I have worked in collaboration with clients on an array of projects including Event Branding, Packaging, Publishing and UI/UX Design and Research.</p>

<p>Holding a degree in Communication and Technology, I enjoy diving into user context with a mind keen to understand their needs from different perspectives, and fathoming out the way to make sense of things through the amalgamation of design and technology.</p>

<p>I believe the origin of creativity involves continuous learning and active collaboration with different groups of people. Throughout my years at university, I have been constantly seeking opportunities to improve my professional skills and expand my experience by attending multiple types of student societies on campus and internships in advertising and startup consultancy.</p>

<p>Aside from that, my social consciousness and inquisitive mind have provided me with the attention to societal matters and the ability to get to the bottom of real-world problems. In our final year project, we tackled the unintended pregnancy issue among teenagers and young adults in Taiwan with the skills in product development and strategic communication. Successfully reached out to 17,331 unique visitors; covered by the media in Taiwan and Hong Kong.</p>
