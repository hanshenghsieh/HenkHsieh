    <h3>Hi, I‚Äôm Henk! I regard myself as a strategic problem-solver who adopts design as the creative approach to build human-centric solutions that deliver meaningful experiences and values.</h3>
    <p>With a degree in Communication and Technology, I strive to bridge the world together through the amalgamation of design and technology to enhance our ways of living and connecting.</p>

<p>Professionally, as a designer, I enjoy diving into user context with a mind keen to understand people's needs analytically and walk in different shoes to fathom out potential solutions for the problems. Kicking off as a freelance designer in college, I am equipped with 3+ years of knowledge and experience in branding, publishing and digital product development.</p>

<p>When it comes to collaboration, I have an innate drive to figure out the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind every decision made in design and development process and get the cross-functional team on the same page by planning out the framework and setting up communication channels across members.</p>

<p>Born and raised in Taiwan, with living experience in Hong Kong, France and Singapore, I also manoeuvre comfortably in cross-cultural settings and bring empathy and open-mindedness to the team.</p>

<p>Currently work as a Product Designer at SkyRec Inc., a video and data analysis company that helps retailers get real-time in-store insight with artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Always keen on getting more involved in product design and development, feel free to drop me a line on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/henkhsieh/">LinkedIn</a>!</p>
