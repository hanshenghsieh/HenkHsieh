    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Between Two Lines is a final year project that tried to tackle and destigmatise the unintended pregnancy issue among teenagers and young adults in Taiwan by developing an informational website that provides legitimate knowledge for people in need to understand the options and related consequences, along with a social media campaign to educate the public with real-life stories, educational content and an interactive storytelling game that allows you to experience the process of decision-making. </p>

<p>Regarding the current sex education in Taiwan, despite the schools have managed to pull off the fundamental knowledge of contraception, we noticed that what happens after finding out the pregnancy in young age is still pretty much absent in our textbooks and educational system. We understand that contraception is the premium key to avoiding all the upcoming troubles. However,  there are still plenty of possibilities that might lead to these unintended results (eg. rape-pregnancy, failed-contraception). Not talking about these issues systematically at all can put the teenagers and young adult in perils when things actually show up unexpectedly. As a result, we decided to tackle this topic in our final year project and create a product that brings value to society.</p>

<p>In this project, I was in charge of User Experience Design (UX), User Interface Design (UI),  Infographic Visualisation, Illustration and Usability Testing. </p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>Since changing the actual education through the bureaucratic system on this subject might require an indefinite amount of time, we want to build an online platform in which all the information and knowledge that have been left out in the textbook can be fully accessible for anybody, especially those in need, at any time, anywhere.</p>

<p><em>But do people really need this?</em></p>

<p>In our pretest questionnaire, with a sample size of 2263, we found out that 73.7% of people received most of their knowledge about unintended pregnancy from the Internet while only 36.3% from the educational system. Furthermore, the Internet has also been ranked as their first place to go for assistance if they were pregnant unintendedly, followed by Family, Friends, Schools and Social Workers. </p>

<img src="images/BetweenTwoLines/Research_1.png">

<p>With the results that showed the significance of the role the Internet played in this matter, we decided to take the journey one step further and looked up the Internet to see what would people get when they turn to Google for help. </p>

<p>Overall, we found a handful of information and disinformation scattered around on the Internet, written by different organisations with different purposes. The only organisation that has put in a good amount of effort to integrate all the related information into one single platform is The Garden of Hope Foundation, which has long been dedicating to women support services in Taiwan. </p>

<p>However, as much as we found this platform sound and thorough, we couldn‚Äôt help but notice that most of the content has been presented in a wall-of-text way on each page. Browsing through all the information had been a cognitively overwhelming experience for us, who were not in any frantic situation in which those unintendedly pregnant might be. And that rendered us the final decision on building our own platform with the aim to design a better experience that can truly help people in need process the information.</p>

<h2>Planning</h2>
<p>After we‚Äôd come to the conclusion that people do first check out the Internet for the information about unintended pregnancy despite it can be all over the place, we decided to make building the platform with a better information processing experience one of our goal in this project.</p>

<p>We conducted several content audits on a couple of websites in order to learn the general landscape of the content strategy on social issues. We then reached out to several organisations, including The Garden of Hope Foundation, to get a deeper understanding of the services they offer and the knowledge we need for composing the content.</p>

<h4>Always Arrange the Information with a Clear Goal</h4>
<p>The platform built by The Garden of Hope Foundation had been our main reference on the content strategy with the four main focuses on this subject: Adoption, Foster Family, Abortion and Parenthood. Whereas, the primary issue of the platform in regard to the user experience is processing the information can be cognitively overwhelming for it doesn‚Äôt a further categorisation under the four focuses.</p>
<img src="images/BetweenTwoLines/IA_1.png">

<p>Therefore, we came up with the new information architecture as the basis of the structure that classifies the key knowledge of the four main focuses heuristically into multiple levels in accordance with the attributes alongside the other content we tailored for the platform.</p>

<img src="images/BetweenTwoLines/IA_2.png">

<h4>Always Be User-centric & Content-driven</h4>
<p>The main purpose of wireframing is to assist the internal discussion over product development. We‚Äôd assessed the rudimentary design ideas and the user flows over the wireframes. Also, in order to ensure the commitment to the user perspectives from the beginning, instead of using Loren Ipsum as placeholder text for the design of wireframes and interfaces, we incorporated the content that we were planning to present on the platform.</p>

<img src="images/BetweenTwoLines/2.png">

<h4>Always Get Feedback from Users</h4>
<p>During the development, we had conducted two rounds of usability testing. The first round focused on: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Whether people can complete the assigned tasks under the scenarios</li>
  <li>Whether the information and knowledge presented on the platform comprehensible</li>
  <li>Whether people find the process redundant or challenging. Where and Why</li>
  <li>Whether there is any room for improvement or any suggestions</li>
</ol>

<p>The second round, with similar approaches, focused on the entire platform, including the mobile version to see whether the new solutions fix the problems we learnt from the previous testing before launching. Some of the major changes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Relocate some of the information to make it more balance between each page</li>
  <li>Cancel the introduction page of each option</li>
  <li>Add a drop-down menu on the navigation</li>
  <li>Redesign the style of the title on the issue page to make it more differentiable</li>
</ol>

<h2>Result</h2>
<p>After an incessant process of planning, designing, developing and testing, we officially launched the platform on April 1st, 2019 (LOL). The feedback has been promising as people kept telling us they‚Äôve learnt a lot through our platform.</p>

<h4>Keep the entry options simple and prominent</h4>
<p>We made the entry options as prominent as possible for people who are in unintended pregnancy. Before they dive into the immense sea of information, they get to know what are the other options besides abortion and parenthood along with the fundamental knowledge about each of them.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in order to avoid the stigmatisation of abortion and make the options more neutral and reassuring, the three main icons were designed in accordance with the imagery of where the matters might take place in lieu of stereotypical symbols of each option.</p>

<h4>Location, location, location</h4>
<p>Users must be able to identify their location at any time. This is one of the goals we set in the beginning. With the stress on being informative, we wanted to make sure that users can explore as much information as they need without getting lost. Normally, people use breadcrumbs as the solution to list out the route for users. We took the same idea but incorporated it into the design. We didn‚Äôt blatantly list out each page on the top or side of the page. Instead, we made the platform indicates the location by showing the signs on our navigation on the top, sidebar on the left and the pagination on the right.</p>

<img src="images/BetweenTwoLines/5.jpg">

<h4>Make it visual and interactional</h4>
<p>To ensure that users don‚Äôt get overwhelmed by the excessive information, we not only reconstructed a new information architecture but also converted some of the texts into infographic and illustrations. Additionally, we further group up the content with toggles that allow users to click and select the topic.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, this project had provided us with a great opportunity to explore and take control of the process of product development independently. In retrospect, we are certain that there is room for improvement, but we are glad that we never only aimed to create something for the final year project, also aimed to bring value to society.</p>
